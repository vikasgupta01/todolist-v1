# todolist
This todolist uses ejs-css to create views and node-express in backend. It stores list-data in an array for now, so data persistence can't be attained post session.
However, in next update it'll use MongoDB-Mongoose setup to make data persistent, and thus making a full fledged todo list app with different views (lists) for different tasks.

## Features : 
1. we can add the elements by typing them in new item field and then pressing enter or clicking + button.
2. After completion of a task, we can mark it done by check marking it, which will as a result show the text crossed.

The image of UI is attached below.
