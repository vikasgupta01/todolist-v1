# todolist
This todolist uses ejs-css to create views and node-express in backend. It stores list-data in an array for now, so data persistence can't be attained post session.
However, in next update it'll use MongoDB-Mongoose setup to make data persistent, and thus making a full fledged todo list app with different views (lists) for different tasks.
